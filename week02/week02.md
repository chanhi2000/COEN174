## PRIORITIZING REQUIREMENTS
- **ex**:
    - absolutely necessary: **critical**
    - highly desirable: **recommended**
    - possible: **suggested**

## ANALYTICAL HIERARCHICAL PROCESS
- more rigorous approach
- **key idea**: compare components / requirements parallels


#### EXAMPLE: [AHP](#analytical-hierarchical-process)
- 3 major requirements (R1, R2, R3)
- R1 is 4x as important as R2
- R1 is 2x as important as R3
- R3 is 2x as important as R2
- **Q**: *What is the overall importance of each?* [on MIDTERM]

## REQUIREMENT: DEFINITIONS, PROTOTYPING, REVIEWS
- customer involved? **YES**
- definition involves writing up the requirements
- if we need clarification, we can prototype
- prototypes are common for user interface
    - **low-fidelity**: papers/cards
    - **high-fidelity**: mockup in a browser / Visual Basic
- results go through a review


## REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION
- customer involved? **NO**
- this is what customer will sign OFF on
- in some organizations
    - **requirement documentation [HI]**: written more for **customers**
    - **requirement specification [LO]**: written more for **technical folks**
    - some specification languages are even executable


## REQUIREMENT AGREEMENT
- customer involved? **YES**
- customer signs, marking end of requirement engineering


## ANALYSIS MODELS
- "formal model" is used to write up the results of analysis
- #### structured analysis (1960s)
- #### unified modeling language (1990s)
- **difference**:
    - **structured analysis** considers data and operations separately whereas **object-oriented analysis** considers them together

#### SCENARIO-BASED MODEL
- user satisfaction is key to the success of a system
- therefore, models involving the user are usually constructed first
- **a user case** describes how a “user” interacts with the system to accomplish some goal or perform some action
- **example**:
- **user case**:
    
    ![user-case](img/[COEN174]week2a-diagram2.png)
    
    ![user-case](img/[COEN174]week2a-diagram3.png)
- The diagram itself is not enough
- we also need **narrative**
    - **name**
    - **actor(s)**
    - **precondition**
    - **postcondition**
    - **goal**
    - **steps** in a typical system
    - **exceptions**

- **example**:
    - **name**: login 
    - **precondition**: none 
    - **postcondition**: user authenticated
    -  **goal**: authenticate user 
    - **steps**:     
        1. enter username 
        2. enter password 
        3. information is submitted 
        4. user taken to landing screen 
    - **exceptions**: username/password incorrect -> retry
