## PRIORITIZING REQUIREMENTS
- **ex**:
    - absolutely necessary: ** *critical* **
    - highly desirable: ** *recommended* **
    - possible: ** *suggested* **

## ANALYTICAL HIERARCHICAL PROCESS
- more rigorous approach
- **key idea**: compare components / requirements parallels

## EXAMPLE (AHP)
- 3 major requirements (R1, R2, R3)
- R1 is 4x as important as R2
- R1 is 2x as important as R3
- R3 is 2x as important as R2
- What is the overall importance of each? [on MIDTERM]

## REQUIREMENT DEFINITIONS, PROTOTYPING, REVIEWS
- customer involved? **YES**
- definition involves writing up the requirements
- if we need clarification, we can prototype
- prototypes are common for user interface
    - **low-fidelity**: papers/cards
    - **high-fidelity**: mockup in a browser / Visual Basic
- results go through a review

## REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION
- customer involved? **NO**
- this is what customer will sign OFF on
- in some organizations
    - **requirement documentation [HI]**: written more for **customers**
    - **requirement specification [LO]**: written more for **technical folks**
    - some specification languages are even executable

## REQUIREMENT AGREEMENT
- customer involved? **YES**
- customer signs, marking end of requirement engineering

## ANALYSIS MODELS
- "formal model" is used to write up the results of analysis
- [SA]: **structured analysis** (1960s)
- [O-OA]: **unified modeling language** (1990s)
- how do [SA] and [O-OA] differ?
    - structured analysis considers data and operations separately  whereas **o**bject-**o**riented **a**nalysis considers them together

## SCENARIO-BASED MODEL
- user satisfaction is key to the success of a system
- therefore, models involving the user are usually constructed first
- **a user case** describes how a “user” interacts with the system to accomplish some goal or perform some action
- **example **:
    - **user case**:
    
    ![user-case](img/[COEN174]week2a-diagram2.png)
    
    ![user-case](img/[COEN174]week2a-diagram3.png)
 
- The diagram itself is not enough
- we also need **narrative**
    - **name**
    - **actor(s)**
    - **precondition**
    - **postcondition**
    - **goal**
    - **steps** in a typical system
    - **exceptions**

- **example**:
    - **name**: login 
    - **precondition**: none 
    - **postcondition**: user authenticated
    -  **goal**: authenticate user 
    - **steps**:     
        1. enter username 
        2. enter password 
        3. information is submitted 
        4. user taken to landing screen 
    - **exceptions**: username/password incorrect -> retry

## ACTIVITY DIAGRAMS
- shows the dynamic behavior of the system (or part of the system)
- looks much like a flowchart, but also has notation for concurrency
- ex. **baking a cake **

![baking-a-cake2](img/[COEN174]week2c-diagram2.png)
￼
- ex. **login **

![login](img/[COEN174]week2c-diagram3.png)

## SWIMLANE DIAGRAMS
- activity diagrams but with responsibilities assigned
- ex. **baking cake (again)**

![baking-a-cake3](img/[COEN174]week2c-diagram4.png)

## DATA-BASED MODEL
- identify data and their relationships
- a data object is simply composite information
    - ex: 
    **object** = person 
    **attribute** = first name, last name

## DATA-FLOW DIAGRAM (DFD)
- models how data is transformed as it flows through the system
- decomposed hierarchically
- ex. **a compiler **

## ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM (ERD)
- entities = objects
- ex: **generic one**

![erd1](img/[COEN174]week2c-diagram6.png)￼

- ex: **book**

![erd2](img/[COEN174]week2c-diagram7.png)

- ex: **school **
