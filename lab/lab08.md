## Chapter 8. Testing Plan

To test our platform, we will go through a few series of tests. There will be a platform test where we will test the application on the browsers in the Design Center. The second set of tests will be to verify that all the fields work and nothing breaks. The third set will consist of submission tests to see if everything gets saved successfully. The fourth and final set will be having our system tested by friends to test for ease of use and fluidity of our form.
