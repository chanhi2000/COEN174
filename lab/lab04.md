## Chapter 4. Activity Diagram

__Figure 2__ is an activity diagram describing how a user will interact with the system. The student will begin filling out personal information such as their name, student ID, and a password that will aid in providing better security. After this information is entered, the student can upload a form to our server that matches with the name, ID, and password of that specific user. From this point, the student may edit their form as they please. However, if the form is not in our system just yet, the user will fill out the form in whatever capacity they choose. Both options from the decision node then gives the student the option of saving, sending, or printing their form. The student is allowed to do a combination of these options, taking into account that they have entered their correct name, ID, and password.
