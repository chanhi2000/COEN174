## Chapter 2. Requirements
Based on our current understanding of the problem, the following are the requirements that are to be met within the scope of this project.

### Functional Requirements
- #### Critical:
	- The system will allow both students and faculty to print out the form in a clean and understandable fashion.
	- The system will allow a signature (printed out and signed)
	- The system will show approval status
	- The system will allow students to revise their most recent form online
- #### Recommended:
	- The system will authenticate user using his/her university ID as well as a password.
		- The system will use school's student database for current users
- #### Suggested:
	- The system will allow a Digital Signature (electronic)
	- The system will automate the process of entering previously taken classes into the form to the farthest extent that the school will let us
	- The system will respond to user's input (course name and or number as well as unit tracking)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- #### Critical
	- The system will be adaptable
	- The system will be easy to configure
	- The system will be easy to use (easier than what's currently available)
	- The system will be accessible on all major browsers.
- #### Recommended
	- The system will have access to courses and their contents (units, requirement fulfillments, etc.)

### Design Constraints}
- The system must run on Design Center's server at Santa Clara University
