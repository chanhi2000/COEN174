## Chapter 10. Risk Analysis

__Figure 6__ shows the possible risks involved in the development of this project. The probability of a risk occurring is scaled between 0-1. The severity of the risk is measured between 1-10. The impact is the multiple of probability a risk will happen and the severity of the risk. The mitigation strategies are steps to be taken to minimize the severity of the impact of a risk.
