## Chapter 9. Testing Results

Our system was tested on the computers in the Design Center and performed well on the multiple platforms it was required to work on. 

Where we found problems in our system was rooted in the logic of our code. First, we tested each section of our form and made checks our customer informed us to make. When our system did not give us the right outcome, we made those changes immediately. Later in the development of this project, we met with our customers and got another check on our logic, discovering we had more changes to make within the sections of our form. The suitable changes we made accordingly. 

When testing the saving of our forms, it worked perfectly. If information was entered incorrectly, the correct form would not be loaded until changes were made. In terms of usability, the people we asked to test our system found it very easy to use. Although there is a lot of information to fill out, they did not feel overwhelmed.
