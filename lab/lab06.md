## Chapter 6. Architectural Design

Due to the fact that this project uses web-based technologies, we will be using a client/server architecture. This will be using a mix of HTML and CSS to display the website and JavaScript to handle the form input and any other functionality we will include such as saving the document and generating the printable version for the user to download. On the server, we are using PHP to save and load the form. The interaction will act as a REST Api and the standard for communication between the client and server will be JSON. (See __Figure 5__)
