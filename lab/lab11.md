## Chapter 11. Development Timeline

We adopted Gantt chart (__Figure 7__) as our project development timeline.  Our development timeline includes tasks, their estimated duration time to be completed (by week), and their progress of completion by percentage.  We selected Gantt chart, because it is one of the simple and effective ways to represent the  overall progress of the project.  It informs so that everyone in the team is expected to be aware of his or her assigned task(s) and the due dates.

The colored bars generally represent the amount of time we must plan and spend on each task.
The color is indicated as below:

- ### progress indicator for major tasks
	- #### completed:
		- yellow:
	- #### remaining:
		- black
- ### progress indicator for sub-major tasks
	- #### completed:
		- blue: Team's overall contribution
		- red: Chan's contribution
		- green: Jaelin's contribution
		- oragne: Vincente's contribution
	- #### remaining:
		- black:
